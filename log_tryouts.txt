resit_1 : 
    -> no obstacles 
    -> no PER buffer, just random sampling
    -> window size: 200 x 200
    -> 155 games
    -> no point in letting it train with an exploration rate of 1%. Progress will be slow.
    -> Mean number of frames per game: 153.67
    -> Frames with reward 0: 22542
    -> Frames with non-zero rewards: 1587
    -> Expressed as a percentage compared to total frames: 6.58%
    -> exploration rate 1% reached after 13165 frames in game number 125.



    Conclusion: test with a longer exploration phase
                -> aim at 50% exploration near 500 games.
